        <h3>"HTML tags"</h3>
        <p id="para2">HTML tags are names user by HTMl to determine portions of the web page. It tells the brower how to display
        a page. We can have attributes in our html tags. Attributes gives more information .
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

        <h3>What is an attribute of an HTML tag?</h3>
        <p id="para3">An attribute defines more information about a tag. For example in &lt;img&gt; tag we have <q>src</q>
        and <q>alt</q> attributes where in <q>src</q> we define a location of the image either</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>What is the correct way for HTML tags to nest?</h3>
        <p id="para4">Every tag which is not an empty tag should be properly closed and we can add other tags in them
        in order. At the end we should have a tree like structure where tags are nested inside.</p>

        <h2>Lab Questions</h2>
        <div id="q1Div">
            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p>Total width and hight for this box is 400 ~ 250. Content is 392~242.<br>
            By default the actual size is calculated by adding height/width + padding + border.
            Since we are defining a box sizing : border-box, paddding and border is included in the width
            and height thus we never go beyond the width and height specified in the CSS.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="q2Div">
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p>Total width and hight for this box is 408 ~ 258.<br> By default the
            actual size is calculated by adding height/width + padding + border. Here, unlike above we are defining a
            box sizing : content-box, which is the default value. So we get our 1 + 3 + 250 + 3 + 1
            where 1 is for borderline, 3 for paddings (on both sides) and the actual 250 we have defined. Same things
            happens for the width.</p>
