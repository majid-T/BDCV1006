    <h3>"Client / server"</h3>
    <p>Client server is a type of architecture used it networks where there is a centeral server responding
    to requests made by clients for dynamic or static resources through URLs. Web servers in this architecture are
    responsible of generating the response for static resources where on dynamic pages this task is performed by
    application servers usally.</p>

    <h3>"HTML tags"</h3>
    <p>HTML tags are names user by HTMl to determine portions of the web page. It tells the brower how to display
    a page. We can have attributes in our html tags. Attributes gives more information .
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".
    Last Version published is HTML5.
    <br>Examples on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp">W3chools</a><br>
    HTML is managed by W3 on official info can be found on <a href="https://www.w3.org/">here!</a></p>

    <h3>"Git"</h3>
    <p>GIT is a version control system developed by Linus Trevold. It helps you keep track of a projects and also
    makes it possible for multiple developers to work on a same project. Git can be used on your local machine
    but it can also have a remote reository, either on the company's servers where you work or on public sites
    which offer same services such as GitHub and Git Lab.
    More info and good tutorials can be found on <a href="https://git-scm.com/">GIT official web site</a>.<br></p>

    <h3>"CSS"</h3>
    <p>CSS is short for Casscading Style Sheets and is used to add style to an html file. CSS have three kind of
    selectors where you can use tags by tagname in genereal Ex: H1, or you can define classes to use it in
    multiple HTML tags. Classes are defined by adding . in frong of your class name  Ex: .myClassName.
    and you can also define an id using # and access specific HTML tag with that id in your page. Ex: #myId.
    Intresting fact about CSS selectors is that they can be chained to make a combinition and have more
    flexible selectors and styles. <br>
    W3 is officially managing CSS and last realesed version is CSS3. More info is available at W3

    <h2>“Lab 2: 2 HTML Knowledge”</h2>
    <h3>What is an HTML tag? Give three examples of tags.</h3>
    <p>An HTML tag is used to define what is the element we are using in the page. They can be used for items we
    are displaying in the page or can hold information about meta data. Tags also can have attributes.
    Example of a meta data tag is <q>link</q> which can point to a style sheet or a java script file. Other
    tags can be mentioned are <q>h</q> a header tag which come in 6 sizes (H1,H2, ... ,H6) and <q>p</q> which
    defines a  paragraph.<br></p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is an empty tag? How does it differ from a regular tag?</h3>
    <p>An empty HTML tag is one that doesn’t contain anything. Examples are <q>br</q> and <q>img</q> tags which
        define a breack on line or a link to an image. Regular tags like <q>p</q> and <q>h</q> tags can hold text
        within them.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is an attribute of an HTML tag?</h3>
    <p>An attribute defines more information about a tag. For example in &lt;img&gt; tag we have <q>src</q>
    and <q>alt</q> attributes where in <q>src</q> we define a location of the image either</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is the correct way for HTML tags to nest?</h3>
    <p>Every tag which is not an empty tag should be properly closed and we can add other tags in them
    in order. At the end we should have a tree like structure where tags are nested inside.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>How do you add an id to an HTML tag?</h3>
    <p id="sampleId"><q>id</q> is an attribute for an html tag and is defined the same way every attribute is defined.
    we use &lt;h1 id="myId"&gt;My Header&lt;/h1&gt; to define an id and we can use it later for CSS or JS.
    This p tag for example has a sampleId define on it to be used in CSS for changing the color. </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>How do you add a class to an HTML tag?</h3>
    <p>Same as <q>id</q>, <q>class</q> is an attribute and can be defined by
    &lt;p id="myClass"&gt; My Paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</p> By this approch we can give multiple elements same class and
    play with their style at the same time. It also save time reusing the style we defined.
    <hr>

    <h3>Why would you use an ID vs a class?</h3>
    <p>Generally <q>id</q> is used when we seek a single element in the DOM where we use <q>class</q> attribute
    to define some <q>p elements in red background while others in blue for example.</q></p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is a type selector?</h3>
    <p>The CSS type selector matches elements by node name. It selects all elements of the given type
    within a document. Example is <q>a</q> element which can be selected by just defining <q>a</q> in
    the CSS file. After that all anchor elements if not defined otherwise will follow the style defined in
    the CSS file.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is the head tag is for? What are some tags that go inside it?</h3>
    <p>&lt;head&gt; tag is used for defining metadata or sometimes to point at external resources such as
    javascript libraries we used in our document. It comes between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. Some
    tags used in them are &lt;title&gt;, &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;script&gt;</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Body is the body tag is for? What are some tags that go inside it?</h3>
    <p>&lt;body&gt; tag represent the document body. Mainly most of the content of the page will be shown
    in this tag. Some tags used in them are &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt; and &lt;table&gt;</p>

        <h4>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
            sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p><br><br><br><br>
            <hr>

            <h4>Why do we use it?</h4>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page
             when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
            readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
            infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
            (injected humour and the like).</p>
            <hr>

            <h4>Where does it come from?</h4>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
            It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
            Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
            more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
            the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
            sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
            by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
            the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
            in section 1.10.32.
            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
            Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
            in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation
            by H. Rackham.</p>

    <h2><q>The Position attribute</q></h2>
    <h3>Q1.  What does position absolute do?</h3>
    <p>Position absolute defines a position of an element according to its parrent element. But if does
    not have parent, it will adjust itself according to the page and browser and acts like a fixed
    position. Exact position can be set by defining top-right-bottem-left on the element.
    </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Q2.  What does position relative do?</h3>
    <p>Position relative is property of position which defines a position of an element
    in the page relative to its normal position by defining top-right-bottem-left on the element</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Q3.  What does position fixed do?</h3>
    <p>The fixed is also property of position which defines a position of an element
    in the page fixed with respect to the top-left corner of the browser viewport. It is always going
    to be in the defined position by defining top-right-bottem-left on the element and may block and
    move over other elements of the page</p>
