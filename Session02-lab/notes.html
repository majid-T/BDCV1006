    <h3>"CSS"</h3>
    <p>CSS is short for Casscading Style Sheets and is used to add style to an html file. CSS have three kind of
    selectors where you can use tags by tagname in genereal Ex: H1, or you can define classes to use it in
    multiple HTML tags. Classes are defined by adding . in frong of your class name  Ex: .myClassName.
    and you can also define an id using # and access specific HTML tag with that id in your page. Ex: #myId.
    Intresting fact about CSS selectors is that they can be chained to make a combinition and have more
    flexible selectors and styles. <br>

    <h2>“Lab 2: 2 HTML Knowledge”</h2>
    <h3>What is an HTML tag? Give three examples of tags.</h3>
    <p>An HTML tag is used to define what is the element we are using in the page. They can be used for items we
    are displaying in the page or can hold information about meta data. Tags also can have attributes.
    Example of a meta data tag is <q>link</q> which can point to a style sheet or a java script file. Other
    tags can be mentioned are <q>h</q> a header tag which come in 6 sizes (H1,H2, ... ,H6) and <q>p</q> which
    defines a  paragraph.<br></p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is an empty tag? How does it differ from a regular tag?</h3>
    <p>An empty HTML tag is one that doesn’t contain anything. Examples are <q>br</q> and <q>img</q> tags which
        define a breack on line or a link to an image. Regular tags like <q>p</q> and <q>h</q> tags can hold text
        within them.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is an attribute of an HTML tag?</h3>
    <p>An attribute defines more information about a tag. For example in &lt;img&gt; tag we have <q>src</q>
    and <q>alt</q> attributes where in <q>src</q> we define a location of the image either</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is the correct way for HTML tags to nest?</h3>
    <p>Every tag which is not an empty tag should be properly closed and we can add other tags in them
    in order. At the end we should have a tree like structure where tags are nested inside.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>How do you add an id to an HTML tag?</h3>
    <p id="sampleId"><q>id</q> is an attribute for an html tag and is defined the same way every attribute is defined.
    we use &lt;h1 id="myId"&gt;My Header&lt;/h1&gt; to define an id and we can use it later for CSS or JS.
    This p tag for example has a sampleId define on it to be used in CSS for changing the color. </p>
    <hr>

    <h3>How do you add a class to an HTML tag?</h3>
    <p>Same as <q>id</q>, <q>class</q> is an attribute and can be defined by
    &lt;p id="myClass"&gt; My Paragraph &lt;/p&gt;</p> By this approch we can give multiple elements same class and
    play with their style at the same time. It also save time reusing the style we defined.
    <hr>

    <h3>Why would you use an ID vs a class?</h3>
    <p>Generally <q>id</q> is used when we seek a single element in the DOM where we use <q>class</q> attribute
    to define some <q>p elements in red background while others in blue for example.</q></p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is a type selector?</h3>
    <p>The CSS type selector matches elements by node name. It selects all elements of the given type
    within a document. Example is <q>a</q> element which can be selected by just defining <q>a</q> in
    the CSS file. After that all anchor elements if not defined otherwise will follow the style defined in
    the CSS file.</p>

    <h3>What is the head tag is for? What are some tags that go inside it?</h3>
    <p>&lt;head&gt; tag is used for defining metadata or sometimes to point at external resources such as
    javascript libraries we used in our document. It comes between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. Some
    tags used in them are &lt;title&gt;, &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;script&gt;</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>Body is the body tag is for? What are some tags that go inside it?</h3>
    <p>&lt;body&gt; tag represent the document body. Mainly most of the content of the page will be shown
    in this tag. Some tags used in them are &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt; , &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt; and &lt;table&gt;</p>
