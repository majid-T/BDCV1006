    <p>I love coding and i think being able to code and create applications is like being a creator.
        I do have a background in programming using Java and Python. I also do have a Bachelor degree in
        computer engineering.
        I do hope that by end of this course (All four courses) veside what i have planned for blockchain
        I would be able to create my own applications using HTML5, CSS3 and Java script.
